# Food-Desert Analysis: Impact of Food Environment on Health

# Why?

A healthy lifestyle is beneficial not only for the individual, but society at large. Healthy diets reduce morbidity and mortality and produce many economic benefits like lower medical care costs, higher productivity, improved quality of life, and increased life expectancy. 

Food environment factors including store/restaurant proximity, food prices, food and nutrition assistance programs, and community characteristics all play a role in communities’ food choices and diet quality. Many Americans fail to meet the most basic dietary recommendations, and this may be partly due to the costs and availability of healthy eating. 

# Project Intent

* By studying food environments and how they vary by city, we can find insights on how this translates to a community’s overall health, and we can quantify the impact of factors such as food assistance programs, restaurant dietary offerings, and restaurant/fitness center density (among other things) on both the health of individual people and the local economy.
